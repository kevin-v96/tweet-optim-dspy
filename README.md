Using DSPy to optimize some custom LLM-judged metrics on auto-generated tweets.

The verbose outputs in the notebook might be hard to sift through, so I've also put the instrumental code in main.py (you might need to move around some code to run it since it's just the notebook exported as a script for easy access to the code) and am putting the results here:

## Annotation
Since we just had the tweets and no labels of any sort, I chose to annotate the tweets with a topic using gpt-4o so that we'd have context for generation.

## Experiment 1: simple 'creativity' metric (1-5)
Using a 'creativity' metric with DSPy, simply instructing it to rate the creativity of the generated tweets from 1 to 5. 
Resulted in most generations being scored 3, making it hard to differentiate between methods. But these were the outputs:

1) Uncompiled program: 320
2) BootstrapFewShot: 320 `(max_bootstrapped_demos=25, max_labeled_demos=4, trainset[:10], running time ~= 3 minutes)`
3) BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch: 290 `(max_labeled_demos = 1, max_bootstrapped_demos=1, num_candidate_programs=2, trainset[:20], running time ~= 10 minutes)`
4) MIPROv2: 330 `(num_candidates=7, init_temperature=0.5, max_bootstrapped_demos=3, max_labeled_demos=4, num_trials=10 minibatch_size=25, running time ~= 20 minutes)`

Here are some example generations:

MIPROv2 did increase our score from 320 -> 330.

But as we can see, most of the scores for creativity turn out to be 3 - this was a problem. The LLM judge is probably having a problem defining 'creativity', especially with topics as 'dull' as business. We need a multitude of 'yes/no' metrics and we need to ensemble them to get a good sense. Plus, it seems like the tweets generated are really long. We need a conciseness metric as well and a limit on the characters generated. It's possible the LLM has issues because we're generating + judging with the same LM, whereas the way it's generally done is a more capable model judging the generation of a smaller/less capable model. Let's try a few changes and see whether they result in improvement. The changes I tried are checkmarked whereas the ones that resulted in improvements are marked with the green ‚úÖ:

- [x] Changing the metric to encompass more measures of a tweet's 'quality' ‚úÖ
- [x] using 4o-mini for generation and 4o for judging ‚úÖ
- [x] Playing around with the hyperparameters of DSPy optimizers a bit more ‚úÖ
- [x] Manually checking a few examples of generation ‚úÖ
- [x] Using a DSPy program that we compile to judge the quality of tweets as a metric. i.e., something like second-order optimization
- [x] Using the tweets dataset for RAG since we can't train on the whole thing. (due to time constraints, Rate limit, etc.) ‚úÖ
- [ ] Trying a different form of annotation/labels than just topics
- [x] Dividing the devset into val and test sets to keep the test set for final testing and preventing data leakage
- [ ] Try an agentic workflow (either with DSPy, with LangGraph/other framework, or a combination of the two) with teacher-student roleplay to see if that improves the generations
- [ ] Evaluate the RAG part with RAGAS
- [ ] Add low-rank adapters or Persona-plug
- [ ] Use outlines/BootstrapFinetune/structured output and manipulate decoding
- [ ] Use Weave or LangSmith for tracing and charting

## Experiment 2: ensemble metric of binary relevant + engaging + creative + concise
Used a more normalized metric - and ensemble of binary 'yes/no' between each of `relevant + engaging + creative + concise`.

1) Uncompiled program: 96.25
2) BootstrapFewShot: 100 `(max_bootstrapped_demos=15, max_labeled_demos=5, trainset[:10], running time ~= 1 minute)`
3) BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch: 95 `(max_labeled_demos = 1, max_bootstrapped_demos=1, num_candidate_programs=2, trainset[:20], running time ~= 2 minutes)`
4) MIPROv2: 100 `(num_candidates=7, init_temperature=0.5, max_bootstrapped_demos=3, max_labeled_demos=4, num_trials=10 minibatch_size=25, running time ~= 30 minutes)`

## Experiment 3: ensemble metric of binary relevant + engaging + creative + concise, with RAG
For the third experiment, I decided to set aside some of our dataset and use it for RAG instead of use the whole thing for dev. Tweets for RAG: 200. Tweets for training: 75. Tweets for val: 25.

1) Uncompiled program: 91.2
2) BootstrapFewShot: 99.2 `(max_bootstrapped_demos=15, max_labeled_demos=5, trainset[:10], running time ~= 1 minute)`
3) BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch: 95 `(max_labeled_demos = 2, max_bootstrapped_demos=2, num_candidate_programs=3, trainset[:20], running time ~= 2 minutes)`
4) MIPROv2: 91.2 `(max_bootstrapped_demos=3, max_labeled_demos=4, num_trials=5, minibatch=True, minibatch_size=5,minibatch_full_eval_steps=2, running time ~= 15 minutes)`

## Experiment 4: Second-order optimization, or metric of metric
For the fourth experiment, I manually defined some examples of how I would like the evaluator to work, then compiled the metric as a DSPy program so that it works more in line with what I expect from it. The dataset is stored under data/metric_trainset. I tried different variations of BootstrapFewShot and BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch with different hyperparams. Sadly, I think due to some bug the score for the optimizer kept stable instead of increasing, and as such the score for the generated tweets from this version stayed the same for all instances: 94.4. This might partly be because of response caching in DSPy by default. Given more time I'd like to debug this and make it work, because I think it can give the tweet quality that extra boost.
